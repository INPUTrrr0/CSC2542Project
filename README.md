# Mine-HRL

## Requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Test wrapped environment with stable standard RL baselines
`python main_sb3.py`

- If you are not familiar with the environment, run `main_sb3.py` in debug mode, and the environment states will be verbosely printed, where current location is printed as -1

## Test wrapped environment with HRL baselines
`python main_HRL.py`

## Tasks
Specify task configurations in `main_xxx.py`, first line of `configure()`

The levels listed here are "clean" environments without the "variants" shown below.

- Level 1 - Get wood (1 option): randomly generate few woods in the environment, just need to get one of them;

- Level 2 - Build plank (2 options): get a wood, and use the wood in the workbench to get the plank; Build bridge (3 options): get a wood and a iron, and use the workbench; 

- Level 3 - Build bed (4 options): get a wood and a grass, use workbench_0 to convert the wood into a plank, then use workbench_1 to convert the plank and grass into a bed; 

- Level 4 - Get gem (6 options): get wood, iron, use workbench_0 to convert the wood into a stick, then use workbench_1 to convert the stick and iron into a axe, use axe to break stone, and get gem; Get gold (5 options): get wood, iron, use workbench to build bridge, use the bridge in a right place (if not, the agent need to rebuild) , and get gold;

Noted that, "option" here means how many human instructions given (ideally it may learn those options). Of course, human can also regard all "get" as an option.

- Variants: larger/smaller map size, more/less resource (default: 4 for each essential resources), distraction workshops/items (no use for achieving the goal), OOD (initial world scenario changes on each reset()), stochasticity

- Different rewarding scheme: `./environment/env_wrapper.py`



Craft your own task:
- add an config in `./experiments/`

- add an recipe in `./resources/` (refer to `recipes_all.yaml`)

- Specify task configurations in `main_xxx.py`

# TODO
- Implementing agents above (manage the hyperparameters in a yaml for each algorithm)
- Eval mode
- Plotting (curve for steps to reach the goals, successful rate, ...)
- Systematic logging
- Different Levels (map size, task complexity (horizon required), OOD, stochasticity (both levels))
- Better state repr (currently we are using simple tricks, and bag (inventory) state is redundant)
